                My legal name is Pin-Chu, but I go by Michael and even to this day, I still remember
                the first time I got onto the back of my honorable grandfather's dragon. A budding
                13 year old squire, with a flare for adventure in his eyes. One that was extinguished
                after just a few flips and turns in the air. At the time, my mind clearly remembered
                holding onto my grandfather's sturdy back for dear life, but my body, my muscles 
                were remembering each movement and position that he took to do the aerial acrobatics
                that our kingdom was so proud of.

                        <p>This course is about HTML/Java Script/CSS. This professor
                            is very interesting and interactive during lecutres. Woohoo

                        <li><b>COMP 1800: Projects 1</b></li>
                        <p>This course is about managing a team project then coding it in
                            Javascript. So far we're in the early parts of the course. 
                            Not much to say, boring class so far tbh. But boring isn't
                            neccessarily a bad thing.

                        <li><b>COMP 1712: Biz Anaylsis and System Design</b>></li>
                        <p>Almost the same as above, a course about a team project. This course
                            has some overlapping content with COMP1800 about developement methods,
                            specifically, in our case the agile method. Kind of boring but a 
                            course that is worth attending.
